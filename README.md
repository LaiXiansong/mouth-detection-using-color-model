# mouth-detection-using-color-model
Here's a simple mouth detection code using DIP color model.

## why create this repo
Many image-related tasks now use deep learning methods, and it is rare to see faces detected by **classical digital image processing** methods. 

The code in this repo simply refers to some work to extract the mouth of the face and determine whether it is open.
